## **Day 1: PostgreSQL Focus**

### **Morning (4-5 hours): Basics of PostgreSQL and SQL Queries**
1. **Understand Data Types and CRUD Operations**
   - Learn PostgreSQL data types (e.g., `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `JSONB`).
   - CRUD operations: `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
   - **Practice:** Write basic queries to insert, update, and delete data.

2. **Filtering and Sorting Data**
   - Filtering using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, comparison operators.
   - Sorting with `ORDER BY`, limiting results using `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`.
   - **Practice:** Write queries that filter and sort data based on conditions.

### **Afternoon (3-4 hours): Joins, Subqueries, and CTEs**
1. **Joins**
   - Learn `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.
   - Joining multiple tables and working with self-joins.
   - **Practice:** Write queries to join multiple tables.

2. **Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
   - Correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
   - Using `WITH` for CTEs.
   - **Practice:** Write subqueries for selecting data or performing aggregation.

### **Evening (2-3 hours): Advanced Topics and Transactions**
1. **Transactions and ACID Properties**
   - Understand `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
   - Learn about isolation levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable.
   - **Practice:** Simulate a transaction and manage rollbacks.

2. **Indexes and Query Optimization**
   - Types of indexes: `B-Tree`, `GIN`, `GiST`.
   - Using `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance.
   - **Practice:** Create indexes and optimize a query with `EXPLAIN`.
