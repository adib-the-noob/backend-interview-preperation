## **Day 2: FastAPI Focus**

### **Morning (4-5 hours): Basics of FastAPI and Request Handling**
1. **FastAPI Introduction**
   - Creating a FastAPI application, defining routes, handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - Learn how to handle path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies.
   - **Practice:** Build a simple FastAPI app with basic CRUD operations.

2. **Request Handling with Pydantic**
   - Learn how to validate request bodies using Pydantic models.
   - Practice handling form data and file uploads.
   - **Practice:** Write a simple API that accepts data via POST and returns a response.

### **Afternoon (3-4 hours): Authentication, Security, and Dependency Injection**
1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Learn how to implement JWT authentication in FastAPI.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC).
   - **Practice:** Implement a simple login system using JWT for user authentication.

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Learn how to use FastAPI's `Depends` for dependency injection.
   - Use dependencies to manage things like database connections or authentication.
   - **Practice:** Use `Depends` for managing user authentication.

### **Evening (2-3 hours): Testing, Deployment, and Performance Optimization**
1. **API Testing with Pytest and TestClient**
   - Learn how to write tests for your FastAPI app using `pytest` and FastAPI's `TestClient`.
   - **Practice:** Write basic tests for your API's endpoints.

2. **Deployment and Performance**
   - Learn the basics of deploying FastAPI apps with Gunicorn and Nginx.
   - Performance optimization: Use background tasks and caching (e.g., Redis).
   - **Practice:** Containerize the FastAPI app using Docker.
